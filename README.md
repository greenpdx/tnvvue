# tnvvue
> Tax N Vote App
This web application allows the people of America to "vote" where their Tax Dollar should go. The main site is at [Tax N Vote](https://taxnvote.org) and [github TNV](https://github.com/greenpdx/taxnvote)

## Why TNV is important
When the system is broken, just changing the colors of the players does not help. It takes changing the rules. TNV adds another feedback to the US government by creating hard data that can be used to create a peoples budget that is given to congress after the tax season.

## Why Open Source
I want the system and software to be transparent. The whole process has privacy and security built in to the system. It should be fun and easy to use.

## Build Setup

git clone https://github.com/greenpdx/tnvvue.git
cd tnvvue

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
