parties submit candidates and then try to influence the people to
vote for them. The election process uses a huge amount of money to
filter the peoples ideas into votes for people that “represent
their ideas”This money is used for advertising, rallies and
logistics trying to make people think that the politicians know what
is best for them.  The cost of the 2016 federal election was 6.8
billion dollars and that does not include state and local elections. 
The presidential election really only comes down to approximately 7
state that decides the victor. When they do get elected, they are
continually reminded what is important to the “people” by the
lobotomists(<i>sp</i> <i>lobbyist</i>).  The lobbyist spend over 3
billion a year trying to influence Congress and the President. Right
now the approval rating of Congress is 15%. The biggest problem is
that elections are the only feedback to politicians.</p>

verifies the format and anonymize the data creating a receipt that is
sent back to the taxpayer. This anonymous data is send to the Census
Bureau. The receipt allows the taxpayer to verify their data in the
database. The aggregate data is kept secret until after the tax
